## Getting Started

### Description

This was my first time ever seeing Circuit Python and a Metro Express board! Overall, my first experience with both of these programs was positive. I ran into some technical difficulties at the start, but was able to overcome them by looking up the instructions created by Adafruit and recieving help from Mr. H. I did not complete any assignments this week, I was mostly getting used to Circuit Python and figuring out how to use the program.

### Reflection

The program does not seem very difficult, however, since I am still getting started I expect to run into some problems. Although, I know that I will be able to overcome the issues I encounter with time and more getting used to using Circuit Python.
